## A simple telephone directory using splay tree data structure
### Some of the main features are :
- Insertion of new records (The person's name and his phone number)
- Deletion of existing records in the directory (Deletion based on the person's phone number)
- Search for a particular phone number
- Advanced search, Searching a phone number with the first few initial numbers. Have implemented the longest common subsequence(LCS) dynamic programming algorithm to find all the relevant records
- Display the frequently searched records along with the frequency of their search
- Displaying the splay tree using pre-order traversal algorithm
